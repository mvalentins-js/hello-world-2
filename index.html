        Shannon Bennett's no-fail almond and orange cake
This semolina, almond and orange cake with lemon curd cake was adapted a few years ago from a Jamie Oliver recipe. I was with family and friends just outside Rome and the house we rented had a garden scattered with orange and lemon trees loaded with citrus ready to burst. I used the oranges that had already fallen on the ground. Jamie’s original calls for an orange syrup to be poured over the whole cake when it comes out of the oven, but I found my oranges so full of aroma from the skins’ oils that the syrup wasn’t needed. I made a lemon curd instead and dolloped some fresh local mascarpone on each serving plate.
